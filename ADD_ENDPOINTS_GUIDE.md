# How to Add Missing Endpoints to Your Backend

Your backend server is running successfully, but some endpoints are missing. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Open Your Backend.py File

Open `Backend.py` in your code editor.

## Step 2: Add the Missing Endpoints

Copy all the endpoint functions from `scripts/add_missing_endpoints.py` and paste them at the end of your `Backend.py` file, before the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

The endpoints you need to add are:

1. **GET /analysis/dashboard** - Dashboard overview statistics
2. **GET /stock/levels** - Current stock levels for all products
3. **GET /analysis/historical** - Historical sales with size breakdown
4. **GET /analysis/best-sellers** - Top N best selling products
5. **GET /analysis/total-income** - Total income analysis with growth metrics

## Step 3: Verify Imports

Make sure these imports are at the top of your Backend.py:

\`\`\`python
from data_analyzer import size_mix_pivot, performance_table, best_sellers_by_month, total_income_table
from Notification import generate_stock_report
from sqlalchemy import text
\`\`\`

## Step 4: Restart Your Backend Server

After adding the endpoints, restart your backend server:

1. Press `CTRL+C` to stop the current server
2. Run again: `uvicorn Backend:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`

## Step 5: Test the Connection

Refresh your frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and check:

- ✅ Dashboard should show real statistics
- ✅ Stocks page should display stock levels
- ✅ Upload functionality should work
- ✅ Notifications should load
- ✅ Analysis page should show all data

## Current Status

Your backend is running and accepting connections (CORS is working), but returning 404 errors because these endpoints don't exist yet. Once you add them, everything will work!

## Need Help?

If you encounter any errors after adding the endpoints, check:

1. Python syntax errors in the terminal
2. Database connection is working
3. All required functions exist in your data_analyzer.py and Notification.py files
